# Bug Tracking

Guidelines on how bugs should be reported.

## Intro

The higher quality the bug report, the more chance the defect will be fixed and re-tested.
Giving stakeholders - such as developers, testers and account managers - as much information as possible means that they can work more efficiently at identifying and fixing the bug whilst considering anything else any fix might impact.
